# E-commerce Website Testing with Cypress

This project utilizes Cypress to perform end-to-end testing on a basic e-commerce website. The tests cover essential functionalities such as searching for a product, adding items to the cart, increasing the quantity, proceeding to checkout, selecting regions, and completing the purchase.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Running Tests

To run the Cypress tests, execute the following command:

```
npx cypress open // npx cypress run
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select the browser in which you want to run the tests.

## Test Cases

The following test cases are covered in this project:

1. **Search Product**: Verifies the functionality to search for a product.
2. **Add to Cart**: Tests the ability to add items to the shopping cart.
3. **Increment Quantity**: Checks if the quantity of items in the cart can be increased.
4. **Proceed to Checkout**: Verifies the process of proceeding to checkout from the cart.
5. **Select Region**: Tests the selection of a region during the checkout process.
6. **Complete Purchase**: Verifies the completion of the purchase process.

## Folder Structure

- **cypress/integration**: Contains test files.
- **cypress/support**: Contains support files like commands and utilities.
- **cypress/fixtures**: Contains static data used in tests.

## Notes

- Ensure that the e-commerce website is running and accessible before running the tests.
- Update the base URL in `cypress.json` if the website URL changes.
